In Dart, when a variable is declared as a var type, it can hold any value such as int and float. The value of a var variable can not change within the program once it is initialised at declaration.


The final keyword is used to hardcode the values of the variable and it cannot be altered in future, neither any kind of operations performed on these variables can alter its value (state).


The print() statement brings the cursor to next line while stdout.write() donâ€™t bring the cursor to the next line, it remains in the same line.


In Dart, when a variable is declared as a dynamic type, it can store any value, such as int and float . The value of a dynamic variable can change over time within the program.

is!  	False if the object has the specified type

void main() { 
   int n = 2; 
   print(n is int); 
} 
OUTPUT: true

void main(){
  double d = 78.55;
  print(d is! int);
}
OUTPUT: false

   String s = "ss";
  print(s.isEmpty); // returns bool value
 print(s.isNotEmpty); // returns bool value

}

12
10.91
